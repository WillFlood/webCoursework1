    <h2>What We Offer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Create Events:</strong> Organize your own events and invite others to join. This is great for businesses to promote a sale, or a limited time event happening 
            or even if you need some volunteers! Your event, when created, can be viewed by anyone, reaching a wide audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Discover Events:</strong> Explore a wide range of events created by users in various categories.</li>
        <li><strong>RSVP with Ease:</strong> Let event organizers know you're attending with a simple RSVP feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Upvote Events:</strong> Show your support for events you love by liking them. This also saves your events to a page in which you can come back to visit later! 
            Liking an event is a great way if you are not sure whether you want to go to it!</li>
        <li><strong>Manage Your Events:</strong> Keep track of events you've created, RSVP'd to, or liked in an easy-to-use dashboard.</li>
    </ul>
